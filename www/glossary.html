         <dt>Definition List</dt>
         <dd>A list of terms and their definitions/descriptions.</dd>
         <dt>Daily Scrum </dt>
         <dd> A daily meeting for the Development Team, time boxed to 15 minutes. The purpose of the Daily Scrum is for the Development Team to update their Sprint Backlog to deliver as much "Done" incremental value as possible by the end of the current Sprint. Any impediments to delivering that value are identified and the Development Team and Scrum Master work to remove them.</dd>
         <dt>Process Manager</dt>
         <dd>The Scrum Master is said to manage the process of the Scrum Framework. The SM is NOT a personnel manager.</dd>
				 <dt>Product Backlog</dt>
         <dd>An ordered list of value-added items to be implemented in software by the Development Team(s). Each item describes the functionality to be added and "acceptance criteria" describing how the Development Team will know they have implemented the functionality correctly. The relative effort for each item is estimated by the Development Team.</dd>
				 <dt>Sprint Backlog</dt>
         <dd>Owned by the Development Team, the Sprint Backlog identifies the Product Backlog items to be implemented in a Sprint along with how the Development Team will implement them. There is a new Sprint Backlog for each Sprint.</dd>
				 <dt>Scrum Team</dt>
         <dd>The Scrum Team consists of the Product Owner, the Development Team, and the Scrum Master.</dd>
				 <dt>Sprint</dt>
         <dd>Each Sprint is a fixed-length iteration during which the Scrum Team forecasts the work, executes the work and inspects and adapts the work. It is always one month or less and should be the same amount of time every Sprint to help the Team achieve a development cadence. The Sprint contains all other Scrum events and there are no time gaps between Sprints.</dd>
				 <dt>Sprint Burndown</dt>
         <dd>An optional view of the work remaining during the Sprint. The Development Team may choose to use a Burndown chart to gain better insight into where they are in delivering the most value possible by the end of the current Sprint. The Sprint Burndown chart is usually derived directly from the Sprint Backlog and is owned and managed by the Development Team
			</dd>
				 <dt>Sprint Goal</dt>
         <dd>The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog items. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal.</dd>
				 <dt>Sprint Planning</dt>
         <dd>At the start of every Sprint, the Scrum Team plans the Sprint in two parts: First, the Development Team estimates which Product Backlog items they can complete to be available in the Done increment at the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Goal is crafted as part one of Sprint Planning.  Second, the Development Team identifies how they will achieve the Done increment.  The guideline time box for Sprint Planning is 2 hours for every week of Sprint (e.g., a 2 week Sprint should spend no more than 4 hours planning the Sprint).</dd>
				 <dt>Sprint Retrospective</dt>
         <dd>After the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team reviews the processes by which they worked during the Sprint (inspecting themselves) with a goal of changing (adapting) those processes to make the next Sprint work better. The Sprint Retrospective reviews and modifies the State of the Process. The guideline time box for Sprint Retrospective is 1 hour for every week of Sprint (e.g., a 2 week Sprint should spend no more than 2 hours in a retrospective).</dd>
